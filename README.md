📝 Project Description (Short Version):
SkillFlow is an innovative Skill-Sharing & Learning Platform that empowers users to showcase their skills, share their learning journeys, and create structured learning plans. With features like skill posts, learning progress updates, social interactions (likes, comments, follows), and OAuth 2.0 authentication, SkillFlow creates a vibrant community for knowledge exchange. Built using Spring Boot (backend) and React (frontend), it offers a modern, scalable, and user-friendly experience while giving developers full-stack development experience.
